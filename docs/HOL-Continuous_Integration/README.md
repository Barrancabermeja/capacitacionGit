HOL - Parts Unlimited WebSite Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services
====================================================================================
In this lab we have an application called PartsUnlimited. We want to set up
Visual Studio Team Services to be able continuously integrate code into the master
branch of code. This means that whenever code is committed and pushed to the
master branch, we want to ensure that it integrates into our code correctly to
get fast feedback. To do so, we are going to be setting up a Continuous Integration build (CI) that
will allow us to compile and run unit tests on our code every time a commit is
pushed to Visual Studio Team Services.

### Pre-requisites: ###

-   An active Visual Studio Team Services account

### Tasks Overview: ###

**1. Import Source Code into your VSTS Account:** In this step, you will connect your own Visual Studio Team Services account, download the PartsUnlimited source code, and then push it to your own Visual Studio Team Services account. There are two approaches to doing this: a) Use the Git command line, or b) Use Visual Studio.  

> Note: VSTS does support GitHub source code integration for use with VSTS builds, but is outside of the scope of this HOL

**2. Create Continuous Integration Build:** In this step, you will create a build definition that will be triggered every time a commit is pushed to your repository in Visual Studio Team Services.

**3. Test the CI Trigger in Visual Studio Team Services:** In this step, test the Continuous Integration build (CI) build we created by changing code in the Parts Unlimited project with Visual Studio Team Services.

### I: Import Source Code into your VSTS Account with Git

We want to push the application code to your Visual Studio Team Services account in
order to use VSTS Build.

> **Talking Point:** For this lab we are using the VSTS Git project. The next couple of steps will allow you to add the PartUnlimited source to the Git master repository.

If you haven't already, create a new team project in your Visual Studio Team Services account that uses Git for source control.

![](<media/empty-vsts-git.png>)

**1.** Use the Import button to import the repository from Github.

Click on `Code` to navigate to the code hub of your team project. This page has instructions for cloning this repo to your hard drive
or pushing existing code. Since this is an empty repo, neither of these options apply in this case.

Locate the `Import` button and click it:

![](<media/CI19.png>)

Enter the URL to the Github repo 

```
https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited
```

and press `Import`.

![](<media/CI20.png>)

It will only take VSTS a few moments to import the repo - once it is complete, you will get a Success message. After a few seconds,
VSTS will automatically redirect you to the file view of the repository.

![](<media/CI21.png>)

Congratulations, your code should now be in VSTS!

**2.** Clone the repo to your hard drive.

> Note: You do not have to do this unless you are going to need the source code opened in Visual Studio.

Create a parent **Working Directory** on your local file system. For instance, on a Windows OS you can create the following directory:

```
C:\Source\Repos
```

Open a command line (one that supports Git) and change to the directory you created above.

In VSTS, right-click the `Clone` button on the top right of the repository File view. Click the `Copy` button to copy the URL of the repo to
the clipboard.

![](<media/CI23.png>)

Clone the repository using the `git clone` command. Type `git clone`, then a space and then paste in the URL you just copied. You can optionally add another space and a repo name. In the example below, the clone will be copied into a directory named HOL. Feel free to use whatever directory name you like, or leave it blank to use the default directory name:

```
git clone <vsts-git-url> HOL
```

After a few seconds of downloading, all of the code should now be on your local machine.

### II. Create Continuous Integration Build

A continuous integration build will give us the ability check whether the code
we checked in can compile and will successfully pass any automated tests that we
have created against it.

**1.** Go to your **account’s homepage**:

	https://<account>.visualstudio.com


**2.** Click **Browse** and then select your team project and click
**Navigate**.

![](<media/CI1.png>)

**3.** Once on the project’s home page, click on the **Build** hub at the top of the page, then on **All Definitions**, and then on **New Definition**.

![](<media/CI2.png>)

**4.** Select the **Empty** build definition, and then click **Next**.

![](<media/CI3.png>)

>**Note:** As you can see, you can now do Universal Windows Apps & Xamarin Android/IOS Builds as well as Xcode builds.

**5.** After clicking the **Next** button, select **HOL Team Project**, select **HOL** Repository, select **Master** as the default branch and check **Continuous Integration** then click **Create**.

![](<media/CI4.png>)

> **Note:** We may have multiple repos and branches, so we need to select the correct Repo and Branch before we can select which Solution to build.

**6.** After clicking the **Create** button, On the **Build** tab click the **Add build step** in the Build pane.

![](<media/CI5.png>)

**7.** In the **Add tasks** dialog, select the **Utility** page and then add a **PowerShell** task.

![](<media/CI6.png>)

**8.** Still in the **Add tasks** dialog, select the **Test** page and add a **Publish Test Results**& task.

 ![](<media/CI7.png>)

**9.** Select the **Utility** page again and add a **Copy and Publish Artifacts** task and then click on **Close**.

![](<media/CI8.png>)

**10.** On the **PowerShell Script** task, click on the blue **rename** pencil icon and change the name of the step to **dotnet restore, build, test and publish** and click **OK**

**11.** Select **File Path** for the **Type** property, enter **"build.ps1"** for the **Script filename** property and **$(BuildConfiguration) $(build.stagingDirectory)** for the **Arguments** property.

![](<media/CI9.1.png>)

![](<media/CI9.2.png>)

> **Note:** The build.ps1 script contains commands using the **dotnet.exe** executable used by .Net Core.  The build script does the following: restore, build, test, publish, and produce an MSDeploy zip package.

	[CmdletBinding()]
	Param(
		[Parameter(Mandatory=$True)] [string] $BuildConfiguration,
		[Parameter(Mandatory=$True)] [string] $BuildStagingDirectory
	)
	$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
	#### Restore and build projects
	& dotnet restore
	& dotnet build .\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite --configuration $BuildConfiguration
	& dotnet build .\test\PartsUnlimited.UnitTests --configuration $BuildConfiguration
	#### Run tests
	& dotnet test .\test\PartsUnlimited.UnitTests -xml testresults.xml
	#### Publish
	$publishDirectory = Join-Path $BuildStagingDirectory "Publish"
	$outputDirectory = Join-Path $publishDirectory "PartsUnlimited"
	& dotnet publish .\src\PartsUnlimitedWebsite --framework netcoreapp1.0 --output $outputDirectory --configuration $BuildConfiguration --no-build
	#### Package to MSDeploy format

**12.** On the **Publish Test Results** task, change the **Test Result Format** to **XUnit** and the **Test Results File** to **\*\*/testresults.xml**.

![](<media/CI10.png>)

**13.** On the **Copy Publish Artifact** task, change the **Copy Root** property to **$(build.stagingDirectory)**, The **Contents** property to **\*\*\\\*.zip**, The **Artifact Name** property to **drop** and the **Artifact Type** to **Server**.

![](<media/CI11.png>)

**14** Select the **Variables** page and a new variable that will be used by the build.ps1 PowerShell script; **BuildConfiguration** with a value of **release**.

![](<media/CI12.png>)

**15.** Click on the **Triggers** tab and verify that the **Continuous integration (CI)** option is selected to build the solution everytime a change is checked in. Also make sure the filter includes the appropriate branch (in this case **master** and **Batch Changes** checkbox is unchecked

![](<media/CI13.png>)

> **Note:** To enable Continuous integration in your project, check the **Continuous integration (CI)** checkbox. You can select which branch you wish to monitor, as well.

**16.** Click **Save** and give the build definition a name.

![](<media/CI14.png>)

### III. Test the CI Trigger in Visual Studio Team Services

We will now test the **Continuous Integration build (CI)** build we created by changing code in the Parts Unlimited project with Visual Studio Team Services.

**1.** Select the **Code** hub and then select your your repo, **HOL**.

**2.** Navigate to **/src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/Controllers** in the PartsUnlimited project, then click on the elipsis to the right of **HomeController.cs** and click **Edit**.

![](<media/CI15.png>)

**2.** After clicking **Edit**, add in text (i.e. *This is a test of CI*) after the last *Using* statement. Once complete, click **Save**.

![](<media/CI16.png>)

**3.** Click **Build** hub. This should have triggered the build we previously created.

![](<media/CI17.png>)

**4.** Click on the **Build Number**, and you should get the build in progress. Here you can also see the commands being logged to console and the current steps that the build is on.
![](<media/CI17.1.png>)

**4.** Click on the **Build Number** on the top left and you should get a build summary similar to this, which includes test results.

Next steps
----------

In this lab, you learned how to push new code to Visual Studio Team Services, setup a Git repo and create a Continuous
Integration build that runs when new commits are pushed to the master branch.
This allows you to get feedback as to whether your changes made breaking syntax
changes, or if they broke one or more automated tests, or if your changes are a
okay.
