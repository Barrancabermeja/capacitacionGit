# Parts Unlimited

Parts Unlimited is an example eCommerce website site based for training purposes on the website described in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Project, by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford, © 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR. Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

PartsUnlimited will walk you through implementing DevOps practices using Visual Studio Team Services.
It will also illustrate advanced scenarios such as implementing a recommandation system.
